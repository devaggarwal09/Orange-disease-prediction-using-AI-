you can download the dataset through online .just search orange with disease dataset.

This repository contains a deep learning project focused on predicting diseases in oranges by leveraging a combination of ResNet50, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and GBM. The approach involves freezing the ResNet50 base model to retain its pre-trained feature extraction capabilities, followed by additional feature extraction using a CNN. Finally, the extracted features are passed through a GBM for disease prediction, enhancing the accuracy of the classification. This hybrid model aims to provide more robust results on the orange disease dataset.
